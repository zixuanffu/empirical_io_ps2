# Dynamic discrete choice solution methods
We want to express the intermediate value function in terms of the choice probabilities by making use of $E(A)=P(X)E(A|X)+P(X^c)E(A|X^c)$.

$$\bar{V}(x_{t})=\sum_{a'} P(a'|x_t) \left\{u(x_t,a')+E(\epsilon_{a'}|x,a')+\beta\sum_x'\bar{V}(x')f(x'|x,a')\right\}$$

If we assume that $\epsilon_{a'}$ is i.i.d. and follows the type I extreme value distribution, then $E(\epsilon_{a'}|x,a')=\gamma-\ln(P(a'|x))$.

## Conditional choice probability (CCP) method
> The goal is to express the intermediate value function $\bar{V}(x_t)$ in terms of the choice probabilities $P(a_t|x_t)$.

### Intermediate value function
Recall the intermediate value function
$$\bar{V}(x_{t})=\int V_{t}(x_{t},\epsilon_t)g(\epsilon_t)d\epsilon_t$$
Let us define the dyanmic utility function as
$$\tilde{u}(x_t,a_t)=u(x_t,a_t)+\beta \int \bar{V}(x_{t+1})f(x_{t+1}|x_t,a_t)dx_{t+1}$$
Then the value function can be written as
$$V(x_t,\epsilon_t) = \max_{a_t\in A} \tilde{u}(a_t,x_t)+\epsilon_{t}$$

Back to intermediate value function, it is 
$$  \bar{V}(x_{t})= \int \left\{\max_{a_t\in A} \tilde{u}(a_t,x_t)+\epsilon_{t}\right\}g(\epsilon_t)d\epsilon_t$$


### Choice probability
Also the choice probability given state $x_t$ is
$$P(a_t|x_t)=\frac{\exp\left\{ \tilde{u}(x_t,a_t)\right\}}{\sum_{a_t\in A} \exp\left\{ \tilde{u}(x_t,a_t)\right\}}$$


## Finite period
1. Estimate $\hat{f}(x_{t+1}|x_t,a_t)$ and $\hat{P}(a_t|x_t)$ at every state point.
2. Compute the intermediate value function based on the $\hat{f},\hat{P}$. Then estimate the structural parameters from the value function.

## Infinite period
The full solution method is a **nested fixed-point algorithm**.
We can swap the order of the two steps by making use of the CCP representation to obtain the **nested pseudo-likelihood** algorithm.
From an initial guess of $P^0(a_t|x_t)$, 
1. Obtain a new pseudo-likelihood estimate
$$\theta_K = \arg\max\sum_i^n \ln(\Phi(P^{K-1}(a_t|x_t)))$$
2. Update the conditional choice probabilities
$$ P^k(a_t|x_t)=\Phi(P^{k-1}(a_t|x_t))$$

We give a more detailed explanation of the $\Phi$ function (policy iteration operator).
1. Given a set of choice probabilities $P^k$, we can obtain the value function $\bar{V}^k$ for the $P^k$. 
2. Given the next period expected utility is $\bar{V}^{k}$, we can obtain the new choice probabilities $P^{k+1}$.
3. Then we have updated from $P^k$ to $P^{k+1}$.
